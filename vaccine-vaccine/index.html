            Vaccines in INDIA
        </h2>
     <p class="ab">
        Three vaccines have received approval for emergency use in India by the Government of India that are :-
     </p>
        <ul class="unl">
            <li>Covishield</li>
            <li>Covaxin</li> 
            <li>Sputnik-V</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="abc">
            Covishield
        </p>
        <p class="ab">
            The Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, codenamed AZD1222,and sold under the brand names Covishield and Vaxzevria among others, is a viral vector vaccine for prevention of COVID-19. Developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, it is given by intramuscular injection, using as a vector the modified chimpanzee adenovirus ChAdOx1. The efficacy of the vaccine is 76.0% at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 beginning at 22 days following the first dose and 81.3% after the second dose.
            In India this vaccine is being prepared by the "SERUM INSTITUTE OF INDIA".It's Price is Rs 600.

        <p class="abc">
            Covaxin
        </p>
        <p class="ab">
            COVAXIN®, India's indigenous COVID-19 vaccine by Bharat Biotech is developed in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) - National Institute of Virology (NIV).

The indigenous, inactivated vaccine is developed and manufactured in Bharat Biotech's BSL-3 (Bio-Safety Level 3) high containment facility.

The vaccine is developed using Whole-Virion Inactivated Vero Cell derived platform technology. Inactivated vaccines do not replicate and are therefore unlikely to revert and cause pathological effects. They contain dead virus, incapable of infecting people but still able to instruct the immune system to mount a defensive reaction against an infection.It's Price is Rs 600.
         </p>
         <p class="abc">
            Sputnik-V
        </p>
        <p class="ab">
            The Sputnik V is an adenoviral vector-based vaccine. It uses a weakened virus to stimulate an immune response much like Serum Institute of India's Covishield. "Vectors" are vehicles, which can induce a genetic material from another virus into a cell. The gene from adenovirus, which causes the infection, is removed while a gene with the code of a protein from another virus spike is inserted.

This inserted element is safe for the body but still helps the immune system to react and produce antibodies, which protect us from the infection. Human adenoviruses are considered as some of the easiest to engineer in this way and therefore they have become very popular as vectors.Although the Sputnik V is a two-dose vaccine, it uses two different formulae for its two jabs - 21 days apart.

Apparently the two different formulae will boost the immune system more unlike the same formula used twice. It also gives longer lasting protection and is safe. The formulae are interchangeable during the dosage.It's Price is Rs 600.
